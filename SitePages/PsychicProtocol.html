                    <li> UI was one of the many responsibilities I held during this project where I communicated with other teammates to ensure consistent functionality. </li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> Inspiration for the player status bars came from Dishonored. Similar to how inspiration for the main menu came from Portal. </li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> All game menus are controller supported which when reflecting on the project turns out to be more tedious than initially thought. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> One of my most proudest parts of the project, a large majority of my work was spent on the Radial Wheel.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> The radial wheel works by calculating the distance and angle of the mouse's position from the center of the screen and then highlights and updates the corresponding ability.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> When an ability is selected it sends a update to the players current ability and updates the UI accordingly.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> While I was working on the Radial Wheel, a lot of lessons were learned. One of which was overcomplicating a simple feature by going outside of the requirements of said feature. This fell under "What would you do differently" during our post-mortem.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> I wanted to give proper credit to all the people whos assets we used in our game, this was unfortunately uncommon within similar student projects and that was one thing I wanted to address.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> One of the major inspirations for the games credits was movie theater credits, typically the ones scrolling from bottom to top with a fade-in and fade-out.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> In my implementation of the credits menu, I wanted to make it modular so I could keep adding to the list of assets and proper. That and also putting our Git Commit history (skippable) at the very end to show our progress throughout the project.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> When creating the Main Menu, the idea given was a "simple live scene". I took that and thought of adding randomly switching rotating security cameras that zoomed in and out as a cool gimick of the scene.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> During our Beta Sprint (2nd Month, 3rd week) I felt like the Main Menu was empty. I asked the Team Lead about it and after some discussions on approaching it, we agreed to have a randomly rotating enemy in the middle.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> Fun Fact: The mysterious being (floating rotating enemy model) soon became known within our game universe's God that was spinning perpetually in place in the main menu, potentially providing the powers given to the player.</li>

                    <li> When a checkpoint is reached the next room is loaded and the previous is unloaded, similar to object pooling which is a design method used to increase a games performance.</li>

                    <li> When changing a setting the player must 'Apply' the changes as to confirm them or they can back out of the menu or press cancel, both resulting in reverting the saved data.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> Since more than just player settings were stored in the scriptable object, getters and setters were commonly used within the functionality associated with the object as to retrieve stored data and update it.</li>

                    &nbsp;
                    <li> The team wanted to have spatial audio due to it avoiding the "flatness" of non-spatial audio. Awareness was important to the player and their decision making.</li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li> A neat effect I learned about when implementing audio was the use of a lowpass filter to create a muffled effect on music when inside of game menus.</li>
