        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p class="p225"> Hi there, I'm Kevin Wall, a Game Developer based in Winter Park, FL. </p>
        <p class="p225"> About my personality: I enjoy a wide variety of different genres of movies (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Kingsmen, Imitation Game, Handsome Devil), cooking (Asian cuisine is my favorite), and of course, playing video games (sandbox games like Terraria and Minecraft are especially favorites). When I'm not coding my fingers off, I often binge-watch anime or defeat bosses in Terraria.</p>
        <p class="p225"> My background in Game Development has provided me with a solid foundation in programming and creating unique solutions to unique problems. So far my most outstanding achievement has been working on Psychic Protocol, a first-person hero shooter.</p>
        <p class="p225"> One thing that drives me is expressing my creative thought through my projects, and I aim to always put my all towards any project that comes my way. Putting that creativity and passion into my projects helps me develop as a programmer and especially as a person.</p>
        <p class="p225"> Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin! </p>
        <p class="p225"> Thanks for visiting my portfolio, and I'm looking forward to connecting with similar people in the industry! </p>
