                    <li>
                        We reused my previous class's renderer which helped speed up production and testing.

                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        Benefitted from having clarity in code structure from my previous renderer with debugging options.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <!--<p>
                    The first problem we faced was what graphics API we wanted to use. Our team ended up picking Vulkan due to my familiarity with it from the previous class (3D Content Creation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using my renderer, our team had a head start working on the project and seeing results. My renderer was built with a couple of debugging options that I expanded upon and we used throughout this month (Lighting/Wireframe). The renderer was setup to show my thought process with checking and abstracting functionality into respective headers/classes and how Vulkan's pipeline was laid out.

                        Using Vertex and Fragment shaders to manipulate data sent to the GPU instead of CPU based unparallel computations.

                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        By having the shaders already setup with descriptor sets, passing any extra needed data could be easily added. This is how I added in 3 additional viewports and toggling lighting in the fragment shader.
                    </li>
                    &nbsp;
                    <li>
                        Due to time constraints I implemented the multiple viewports pragmatically. Prioritized quick and effective solutions over elaborate, time-consuming ones.

                        The pausing functionality was done, but we didn't have a way to show it to the user. We didn't even plan on adding it in since we were low on time.

                        I spent a couple hours on the last night crunching away to display the model properly above the player wherever they are because I felt like it wouldn't be right without it.

                        When we were going to merge into the main branch we always did a merge request and had other people view the code and test it to avoid any errors or improper implementations.

                        I would need to update the pipeline each time to account for where the viewport would start and the dimensions, which meant I didn't need to recreate every aspect of the pipeline each frame.
