                    Stat Bars:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hitting our third milestone, the team noticed a problem with the game's health, shield, and focus bars during testing.
                    The issue was that these bars didn't give clear feedback about the player's status.
                    They just lost chunks without showing a gradual change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having a single bar for each stat, I added a second one behind it.
                    When a resource is used, the live bar is updated to reflect the current value.
                    The back bar is then decreased slowly until it equals the live bar's value.
                    This tweak made a big difference by allowing players to see how much health, shield, or focus they had left without any confusion.
                    While the change itself wasn't complex, it allowed players to more accurately gauge the difficulty of an enemy by the damage they dealt.
