                <h2>
                    Stat Bars:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hitting our third milestone, the team noticed a problem with the game's health, shield, and focus bars during testing.
                    The issue was that these bars didn't give clear feedback about the player's status.
                    They just lost chunks without showing a gradual change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of having a single bar for each stat, I added a second one behind it.
                    When a resource is used, the live bar is updated to reflect the current value.
                    The back bar is then decreased slowly until it equals the live bar's value.
                    This tweak made a big difference by allowing players to see how much health, shield, or focus they had left without any confusion.
                    While the change itself wasn't complex, it allowed players to more accurately gauge the difficulty of an enemy by the damage they dealt.

                <h2>
                    The Radial Wheel:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the early stages of developing Psychic Protocol, switching abilities would be crucial to our combat mechanics.
                    Players should have an easy and fast time switching abilities back and forth if they need to beat some challenging enemies.
                    Five abilities were created for the player to use and potential for more to come.
                    There needed to be a way for the player to access them quickly, and for designers to keep adding more in case they were developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created the radial wheel system featured in our game to help address this issue.
                    Displaying the menu would be solved by using the degrees of a circle and dividing it up between the number of abilities.
                    Then by calculating the signed angle between the cursor and the center of the screen,
                    I could find which ability was being hovered over and have that ability highlight and display the name of the power in the middle.
                    In order to promote a better user experience I used images instead of text for the ability segments, and the segments never changed positions.
                    This way when the player became fluent in the game they could easily open the wheel and close it by only moving the mouse slightly.
